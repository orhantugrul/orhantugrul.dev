# Why I Started Learning CS Fundamentals After 4+ Years Experience

So there I was… 4+ years grinding in tech, thinking I had it all figured out. Then, bam! Unemployment hits like a plot twist in a Netflix series. Not exactly what I planned for my 30s (or late 20s if we’re being honest).

I tried to act normal in front of my friends. But deep down… it was depressing. Really depressing. I couldn’t even tell my parents. I mean, imagine telling the people who always bragged about your “career progress” that you’re now binge watching Reels in your pajamas all day.

## The Harsh Reality Check

I started interviewing, thinking I’d breeze through like I always did. But nope. Interviewers were politely showing me the “you’re not that good” mirror. And let me tell you… mirrors don’t lie.

It stung. A lot. But here’s the thing painful reality checks are actually gifts in disguise.

## It’s Never Too Late

I know what you’re thinking. “Wait, you’ve been working 4 years already… isn’t it too late to go back?” Nope. Not at all. (At least science says)

1. [**Neuroplasticity**](https://solportal.ibe-unesco.org/articles/neuroplasticity-how-the-brain-changes-with-learning/):
   Your brain isn’t a fixed. It’s more like a smartphone with constant software updates. Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This means that learning new skills can physically change your brain for the better. So, yes, you can teach an old brain new tricks!
2. [**The 10,000-hour rule is a myth**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2013/05/30/josh-kaufman-it-takes-20-hours-not-10000-hours-to-learn-a-skill/):
   Forget all the “you need 10,000 hours to master something” nonsense. Josh Kaufman found that you only need about 20 hours of focused practice to go from “what even is this?” to “okay, I can handle this” at a new skill. That’s less than a month if you dedicate a little time each day.

So yeah… even after 4+ years of ‘professional experience’, diving back into CS fundamentals isn’t late. It’s just me hitting the refresh button on my brain.

## Thinking… Planning… Leveling Up

After a few days of staring at my ceiling like a philosopher with no thoughts, I made a plan.

- Step one: stop feeling sorry for myself.
- Step two: build a stronger foundation.

That’s it. No fancy frameworks. No 67 step productivity plan. Just back to Computer Science 101 algorithms, data structures, Big O. The kind of stuff that fries your brain but also makes you feel like a wizard when something finally clicks.

Because honestly, I don’t need to reinvent myself. I just need to understand what I’ve been using all these years.

## My Promise to You (and Me)

Alright, let’s be honest with ourselves for a second. We’ve talked big before.
This time, no fake motivation. No overplanning. Just small, consistent work.

Here’s the deal:

- I’ll study computer science fundamentals every day even if it’s just 30 minutes.
- I’ll take notes on what I learn, especially the confusing parts (because those are usually the good ones).
- I’ll let myself suck at first. Progress > perfection.

After 3 months, I’ll come back here and share how it went the wins, the fails.
Let’s see what happens when we actually stick to it.

## Moving Forward

Unemployment really really and really sucked. But turning that low point into an opportunity to level up?
That's priceless. I'll be back. Peace.
