      I'm currently the
      <b><span class="text-sky-600">Software Developer at ITServ</span>.</b>

      I really ‚ù§Ô∏è to building new things with new technologies. Currently,
      heavily working with under JVM ecosystem. I am also exploring the Rust
      programming language, which has gained popularity for its memory safety
      and performance, and I am excited to see how it can be leveraged to
      improve our software development process.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the future, I really want to contribute to open-source. I believe that
      contributing to open-source is a great way to give back to the community
      while also gaining valuable experience, and I am looking forward to
      exploring different projects and finding ways to make meaningful
      contributions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of these things, I have a basic minimal life, where I focus on
      simple pleasures such as spending time with loved ones, listing lo-fi
      tracks, reading books, drinking some ‚òïÔ∏è, and enjoying the outdoors.
